## Open Science - what do we mean with it?

Open science does not have any one fixed definition. We use it as shorthand for 
all scientific practices which aim to enhance:

-   Transparency in experimental methodology, observation, and collection of data.
-   Public availability and reusability of scientific data and code.
-   Public accessibility and transparency of scientific communication.
-   Using web-based tools to facilitate scientific collaboration.

## Open Science - what is the purpose?

The ultimate aims of Open Science are to maximize:

- The overall effectiveness of scientific research.
- The public trust in science.

## Why you should learn about Open Science practices

-   Most of these practices are simply 'good practices' that promote transparency and accountability. Therefore they are going to be important in any profession in the future - not only within science, but also in government and industry.
-   They are complex and it requires training before you can apply (best) practices and (software) tools.
-   Applying OS-practices will be helpful in your own BSc research project - [see this paper](https://portlandpress.com/biochemist/article/43/6/66/230441/The-benefits-of-an-open-science-approach-in)
